# dodo-getaways-backend

Backend to support Dodo Getaways using Go.

Follow the roadmap here: https://trello.com/c/x59sJxEj/17-brochure-idea-tripadvisor

## Setup

Requirements:

1. This project uses Go Modules, thus requires at least **go1.14+**
   Use [gvm]() to easily manage Go versions!

2. I also use VS Code and have settings included in this project to use [gopls](https://github.com/golang/tools/tree/master/gopls) to support Go Modules with minimal setup (hopefully, I'm still figuring things out...)

## Running Locally:

1. Run `go run main.go`. The server will be on port `8000`.
